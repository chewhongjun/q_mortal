    "__Market Identifier Code (MIC)__ is an international standard, which \"specifies a universal method of __identifying exchanges__, trading platforms, regulated or non-regulated markets and trade reporting facilities as sources of prices and related information in order to facilitate automated processing\" as quoted from its official site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __U.S. Equities market has 13 lit exchanges and dozens of Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs), a.k.a. dark pools__. Many buy side firms also operate their own non-ATS crossing systems.\n",

    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be multiple exchanges quoting at the __National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) price level__ at any given time. It is assumed that __child orders are always placed at NBBO_ and can be placed to any lit exchanges__. The below function __simChildOrders__ simulates some BUY orders with execution destination (exDest). See the definition of FIX tag for exDest. It also has a column nbbExchanges, which shows the list of lit exchanges that are present at the best bid price level."
